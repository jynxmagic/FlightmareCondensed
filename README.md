# Flighmare Condensed

This repo contains the Flightmare code, reduced into a single file.
It is designed to be easy to understand.
To build the file, assuming you are on Ubuntu with g++ installed, run

```g++ flightmare.cpp -o flightmare -I lib/Eigen -I nn.h -I eigen_shorts.h```

You can then run the Flightmare binary
